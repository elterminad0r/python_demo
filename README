Run noughtsandcrosses/play.py to play noughts and crosses against computer.

waves.py slowly produces several different types of wave.

fractals.py for fractals in Turtle using Lindermayer systems - meaning each
fractal is coded in just a couple of lines of definitions.

Perhaps a way to expand this, if you have time, is to allow the user to specify
the number of iterations to perform. You could also look for other fractals to
add.

Good Processing things to show people:

If you don't have Git installed, you'll probably need to download ZIP files and
unzip them, then making sure they're in a directory with the same name as the
/.*\.py?de/ file, or Processing will refuse to open.

For the second lot, make sure to have installed Python mode (this should not
required admin access).
